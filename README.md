## Problem Statement
  The problem is to create a program to add to my portfolio displays my skills to potential employers and my professor. The ultimate short-term goal within the next six weeks is to create a cross-platform mobile app that will run on both iOS and Android phones that is able to overlay an AR skeleton over human body within a camera view.  My boundaries are to develop software within the following categories: Android, Gaming, C#, Raspberry Pi, or iOS. The long-term goal is to use Augmented Reality to recognize and display joint positions, and to analyze biomechanics while standing, walking, running, and throwing. Short-term success would be to learn C# and use Xamarin to create a mobile application that runs on both iOS and Android, which uses OpenCV, ARKit and ARCore to recognize the userâ€™s face and construct a virtual skeleton. The main constraints are tutorial materials for Xamarin and the limited time available in the next six weeks to complete the project. I am assuming that C# will have the capability of achieving the short-term goal to create a cross platform mobile application using Xamarin and implementing Augmented Reality/Computer Vision. Another assumption I am making is that I will be capable of learning how to solve this problem and achieving the short-term goal within this accelerated semester. The stakeholders are myself, my professor, and potential employers. The timeline for the completion of the short-term goal of completing a personal project with C# is six weeks. Each week will be a Sprint during which I have set incremental tasks described in the Sprint Backlogs below.

## Sprint Backlog 1
- Choose language and personal project goals (C# and joint detection on iOS and Android)
- Setup IDE and compiler on Windows and Mac
- Download Xamarin framework
- Setup Xam.Plugin.Media
- Connect to Github
- Finish problem statement and plan out the remaining SBL tasks
