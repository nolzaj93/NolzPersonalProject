## COP2001 Personal Project Summer A 2019
The goal of this project was to learn by creating a Xamarin iOS app with future capability to be supported on Android and Windows mobile devices. For the FGCU Programming Methodology curriculum, we were tasked with creating a personal project within a selection of categories, and I chose to use C#. This application was made individually with about a year of experience programming. 


## Demonstration


## Documentation
This project is still in the design phase as I am still learning. Most of the current code is default from creating a Xamarin Forms project and sample code found on Github. 

## Diagrams
Coming soon.

## Getting Started
Download Visual Studio and click the green button to Open in Desktop or Download as a Zip and extract the project. Open the project within Visual Studio to analyze, run, test.

## Built With
Visual Studio for Mac 2019

## Contributing
At the current moment I am attempting to learn how to handle the orientation change event, and how to structure the XAML within landscape.

## History


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
Object-Oriented Programming, MVC Architecture, Cross-platform mobile development, 

## Problem Statement
  The problem is to create a program to add to my portfolio, which displays my skills to potential employers and my professor. The ultimate short-term goal within the next six weeks is to create a cross-platform mobile app that will originally run on iOS that is able to overlay an AR skeleton on a human body within a camera view. My boundaries are to develop software within the following categories: Android, Gaming, C#, Raspberry Pi, or iOS. The long-term goal is to use these technologies to analyze biomechanics while standing, walking, running, throwing and a library of other movements with a cross-platform application available on iOS, Android, and Windows. Short-term success would be to learn C# and use Xamarin to create a mobile application that runs on iOS, which uses OpenCV and ARKit to recognize the userâ€™s face and construct a virtual skeleton over a picture or video. The main constraints are lack tutorial materials for Xamarin and the limited time available in the next six weeks to complete the project. Another constraint is that I do not own an Android device, so I may need to find a way to use a webcam with the Android simulator to test and develop for this platform. I am assuming that C# will have the capability of achieving the short-term goal to create a cross platform mobile application using Xamarin and implementing Augmented Reality/Computer Vision. Another assumption I am making is that I will be capable of learning how to solve this problem and achieving the short-term goal within this accelerated semester. The stakeholders are myself, my professor, and potential employers. The timeline for the completion of the short-term goal of completing a personal project with C# is six weeks. Each week will be a Sprint during which I have set incremental tasks described in the Sprint Backlogs below.

## Future tasks
- Determine if Xamarin is the best option for cross-platform mobile development. I will look into Python development with Kivy, Java development with the Gluon framework, and other cross-platform options. Another option is to spend the extra time to create a native Swift project for iOS and a native project for Android, which may be the best option because documentation and sample code are more abundant for the native languages.
- Build a virtual stick figure with OpenCV over a video
- Outline the torso, arms and legs within the image view
- Estimate joint positions
- Overlay markers over the joint positions
- Learn how to use OpenCV and ARKit to have the virtual skeleton move with the body in real time 
- Record a video of movement with overlay
- Start creating algorithms to calculate joint angles
- Start writing methods to analyze human movements
- Begin converting algorithms to code that recognize movements faults and ideal movement
